## Yahtzee Game
Assignment 4 revolves around the implementation of Yahtzee. 

### Decisions:
We are using cmake as our build tool.

The game is played through the command line.



### Rules:
The project must consist of at least three classes:
Dice
ScoreCard
Game

A game is programmatically created and played through the instantiation of the Game class followed by a call to the play() function.

You must create a set of User Stories related to this game and enter them as issues in the project's Issue section in GitLab.

Each User Story must be assigned to a member of your team.

A Class diagram showing the entire program design must be tracked in the repository.

The Software Engineering process must use the Feature-Branch Workflow (For each user story worked on, a new branch must be created that will eventually be merged back into the master branch).

There must be evidence of merge conflicts and three-way-merges.

You must include an appropriate README.md file. This file must contain accurate descriptions of your game, and how to play it.

When a user story is completed, mark it as closed.



## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
